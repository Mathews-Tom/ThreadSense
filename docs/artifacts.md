# Artifacts

ThreadSense persists artifacts at each major stage so runs are inspectable and rerunnable.

## Storage Root

Default root:

```text
.threadsense
```

Override with:

```text
THREADSENSE_STORAGE_ROOT
```

## Raw Artifacts

Source-specific fetched payloads.

Examples:

- `.threadsense/raw/reddit/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/raw/hackernews/<story-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/raw/github_discussions/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/raw/github_gist/<gist-id>.json`

Purpose:

- preserve source payloads
- support replay without refetching
- support regression testing against real payload shapes

## Normalized Artifacts

Canonical thread artifacts.

Examples:

- `.threadsense/normalized/reddit/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/normalized/hackernews/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/normalized/github_discussions/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/normalized/github_gist/<gist-id>.json`

Purpose:

- source-agnostic `Thread` model
- stable downstream analysis input
- preserved thread-level body when available

## Analysis Artifacts

Deterministic thread analysis outputs.

Examples:

- `.threadsense/analysis/reddit/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/analysis/hackernews/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/analysis/github_discussions/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/analysis/github_gist/<gist-id>.json`

Purpose:

- persisted findings
- duplicate and phrase analysis
- provenance for later report generation

## Single-Thread Reports

Rendered outputs for one analyzed thread.

Examples:

- `.threadsense/reports/reddit/<thread-id>.json`
- `.threadsense/reports/reddit/<thread-id>.md`
- `.threadsense/reports/reddit/<thread-id>.html`

Purpose:

- operator-ready report
- structured JSON report artifact
- richer executive summary fields

## Corpus Artifacts

Cross-thread analysis artifacts.

Example layout:

```text
.threadsense/corpora/<corpus-id>/manifest.json
.threadsense/corpora/<corpus-id>/analysis.json
.threadsense/corpora/<corpus-id>/report.md
```

Purpose:

- manifest of selected analysis artifacts
- cross-thread findings and trends
- corpus-level report and optional synthesis

## Batch Artifacts

Reproducible batch-run outputs.

Example:

```text
.threadsense/batches/<run-name>.json
```

## Research Result Payloads

`research reddit` also returns runtime metadata in the emitted result payload, including:

- selected thread list
- manifest path
- corpus analysis path
- corpus report path
- terminal summary when available

This payload is emitted directly to stdout according to the selected output mode.
